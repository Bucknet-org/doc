## Considerations

Here are some major considerations when it comes to design PoR for a trustless reputation system:

  - **Reputation Score Calculation**: Each participant (data provider, validator, or user, etc.) in the network is assigned a reputation score. This score could be based on various factors, such as historical behavior, uptime, contributions to the network, security measures implemented, and feedback from other network participants. The mechanism for calculating reputation must be carefully designed to prevent manipulation and ensure that it accurately reflects each participant's trustworthiness and contributions to the network.

  - **Identity Verification**: To prevent sybil attacks (where a single user creates multiple identities), participants must undergo a thorough identity verification process. This ensures that the reputation score is tied to a real-world entity. On the other hand, this might raise privacy concerns.

  - **Validator Selection**: When it comes time to create new blocks, the network selects validators based on their reputation scores. Nodes with higher reputations have a greater chance of being chosen to participate in the consensus process. And a node in the network must have a reputation score higher than a set threshold to be able to publish a new block. Also, a judge is randomly selected that is responsible for updating node reputation values. However, none of these addresses the behavior of a node on a transactional basis as it interacts with other nodes in the network.

  - **Block Creation and Validation**: Once selected, validators are responsible for checking transactions, bundling them into blocks, and proposing these blocks to the network. Other nodes with high reputations then verify the proposed block.

  - **Consensus Finality**: The block is considered valid and is added to the blockchain after a certain percentage of the network's reputational power has confirmed its validity. This reduces the likelihood of forks and ensures faster transaction finality.

  - **Reputation Updates**: The reputation scores of participants are continuously updated based on their ongoing behavior and contributions. Malicious actors or those failing to maintain network standards would see their reputation scores decrease, reducing their influence in the consensus process.

  - **Incentives and Penalties**: Participants are incentivized to maintain a good reputation to earn block rewards and transaction fees. Conversely, if a participant acts maliciously or fails to perform their duties, they may be penalized through reduced reputation scores or exclusion from the consensus process.

  - **Enhanced Security**: By tying the consensus power to a measurable and adjustable reputation score, PoR aims to enhance the security of the network. It becomes more costly for attackers to build a significant enough reputation to disrupt the network compared to simply acquiring hash power or coins for a PoW or PoS system.

  - **Network Governance**: PoR can also be integrated with on-chain governance mechanisms, allowing participants to vote on network upgrades and changes based on their reputation scores.

  - **Transparency and Auditability**: The reputation system must be transparent and auditable to ensure trust in the consensus mechanism. All participants should be able to understand how reputation scores are calculated and how they affect the consensus process.

## Cryptographic Primitives

### Hash Functions

We use very secure hash functions generated with the **Elliptic Curve Cryptography** to generate all types of encryption needed. This method is both efficient and performant. It takes any arbitrarily long string and converts it to a fixed-length string. The main characteristics of this hash function is that for a given message, it is easy to compute the hash; but given the hash, it is difficult to compute the message. Hash functions that demonstrate this property are referred to as one-way hash functions.

### Digital Signatures

Digital signatures enable the verification of a message. This verification ensures that a message originated from a particular node. Digital signatures are usually a public key, denoted by pki, used for verifying the signature of node i and a corresponding secret key, denoted by ski, used by node i for signing a message. This process is referred to as encryption. To prevent another node or a malicious node from impersonation, a node should not reveal this key. The purpose of the public key is to verify a signature generated by a secret key belonging to a node in the network. A
digital signature scheme usually consists of three distinct parts:

  - A key generation algorithm,
  - A signing algorithm, and
  - A verification algorithm.

The key generation algorithm is used to generate a new set of key pairs. The main property required from a digital signature scheme is that of security. Without knowledge of a secret key, it is infeasible to find a string that passes the verification algorithm.

### Event System

The concept of an event here is similar to traditional distributed algorithms where each event is defined as a unit of computation across a set of nodes. An event can be described as a tuple where pi is the node at which the event occurs, timestamp representing the exact time the event occurred, and information about the event. This definition is based on the more general formalism from distributed systems where each node of a distributed computation is a state machine and the computation causes a change of state.

### Information Propagation

Information propagation here deals with two main aspects: the first is about propagating information from a group of nodes to all the other nodes in the network. The other aspect is the propagation of information between two interacting nodes. The goal of information propagation is to provide every node in the network with the most recent information. This information propagation is the essence of communication in a distributed setting. Nodes in the network communicate by transmitting and receiving messages. A Message is therefore a unit of communication. A more general definition is that a message is just a finite sequence of bits. In a distributed environment where information is constantly flowing because of the interactions, there needs to be:

  - An efficient mechanism for distributing this information i.e publish and
  - An efficient mechanism to allow nodes to receive these specific kinds of information i.e subscribe.

Specifically, in our scheme, we use a Pub-Sub pattern as the medium for information propagation.

### Voting

The goal of voting is to aggregate individual preferences among a group into a single group ranking. Weighted voting is a voting method that affords certain nodes more privileges on the outcome of the vote than other nodes based on some specific context for which the voting system is deployed. Weighted voting is a form of social choice system originating from the domain of cooperative game theory [1]. They essentially model decision-making processes in which a set of voters make decisions about the outcome of an issue. Each voter is allocated a numeric weight, and the decision is carried out only if the sum of weights of voters in favor of it meets or exceeds some specific given threshold, called the quota.
